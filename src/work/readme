The project calculates the similarity of logical expressions

Input data:
 pre-set logical expressions(file>logic) and final result logical expressions filtered by finalRes.java

Output result: 
file>res

Note: The name of 1-9 in the result of finalRes.java is changed to 01-09, and the name of 100 is changed to 999.
In order to ensure that the output results are one-to-one correspondence, because eclipse calculation is performed according to the serial number from small to large.
For example: pres1.txt > pres01.txt

Modify parameters to perform statistics on phenotypes and loci:
1)name = "30-26" //Data set being executed
2)app.GetRealExp("file\\logic\\Slogic" + name + ".txt")//Pre-set logical expression
3)new File("E:\\PSOlab\\" + name + "\\res\\finals")// Algorithm result
4)new FileOutputStream("file\\res\\S" + name + ".txt") //Output path
